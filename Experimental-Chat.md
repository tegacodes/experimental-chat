##Introduction to Telematic Art and Experiments in Connection

*This lecture is prepared from collaborative research with legendary Carnegie Mellon Prof. Golan Levin. We have written a book on computational art together.*

###Collective Memory & Experimentatal Collaboration

#####Cairns

Cairns are human-made piles of stones. Cairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present, often as landmarks, memorials and trail markers. It is a collaboratively created structure, built one stone at a time, often over the course of centuries.

#####Your World of Text

Andrew Badr's Your World of Text is an infinite grid of text editable by any visitor. "The changes made by other people appear on your screen as they happen. Everyone starts in the same place, but you can scroll through the world using your mouse. Put any letters at the end of the URL to go to a new world. For example, http://yourworldoftext.com/forexample. They all start off blank. You can also create a custom world for you and your friends."

#####Telegarden (1995)

Ken Goldberg & Joseph Santarromana's TeleGarden is an art installation that allows web users to view and interact with a remote garden filled with living plants. Members can plant, water, and monitor the progress of seedlings via the tender movements of an industrial robot arm. The Telegarden was developed at the University of Southern California and went online in June 1995. In its first year, over 9000 members helped cultivate. In September 1996, the Telegarden was moved to the lobby of the Ars Electronica Center in Austria, where it remained online until August 2004.

#####The Smaller Picture (2002)

The Smaller Picture (2002) by Kevan Davis is one of the first massively crowdsourced Internet artworks, and is still operational at https://kevan.org/smaller.cgi, but the best part is no longer there — an emergent alphabet created by the hive mind:


###Intimacy from a Distance 

#####Hole in Space (1980)

Hole in Space (1980) was a "communication sculpture" by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz, which used live two-way video to connect street-level audiences in Los Angeles and New York City.

#####The Trace (1995)

In The Trace (1995), an interactive installation by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, a participant encounters the moving, ghostlike "presence" of another person, who is located in an identical but separate room. Their presence is conveyed by a glowing spot created by a pair of intersecting beams of light.

#####Can We Talk? (2011)

Zach Gage's Can We Talk?(2011) "is a chat program for having serious conversations. It attempts to disambiguate the reasons for silence in online conversation, while preserving the qualities that make text chatting a unique platform for communication." (Gage)

###Glitching Communication

*How might you celebrate the glitches in communication (See Menkman's Glitch Manifesto)*

#####Telephone Picture (László Moholy-Nagy, 1923)

The first use of telecommunications as an artistic medium occurred in 1923 when the Hungarian constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy made Telephone Pictures. These works questioned the idea of the isolated individual artist and the unique art object.

"In April 1923, Moholy had Construction in Enamel 2 and 3 made at a local enamel factory. He would later claim to have ordered them by describing them over the telephone, exaggerating both his distance from the manufacturing process that produced them and the degree of technological mediation involved. In doing so Moholy presented the artist in the modern age as producer of ideas rather than things. While sharing the same abstract geometric composition, the works use a mathematical progression to change its scale, highlighting the conception of the image as transferable data." (MoMA)

#####Somebody By Miranda July

#####MWITM (Man / Woman In The Middle)

Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald play with the concept of a computer security attack called a "man in the middle attack", where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. In this case, they set up a system to MITM attack their own relationship. Their texts to each other were intercepted by a server and it had the ability to: modify a message as it is being sent or received, reply to a message instead of modifying or relaying it, and initiate new conversations without any actions from Lauren or Kyle.

###The Joy of Low Bandwidth

*How might you explore and celebrate limitations?*

###Exploring Other Intelligences

#####Sandy Speaks (2017)

American Artist’s installation SandySpeaks (2017) explores the possibilities ofchat from beyond the grave. Using a customtrainedAI chatbot, this project places a visitorin conversation with the real words of SandraBland, who discussed racism and policebrutality in an extensive series of YouTubevideos just weeks before her own death inpolice custody.

#####Social Turkers (2013)

Lauren McCarthy's Social Turkers (2013) asks: "What if we could receive real-time feedback on our social interactions? Would unbiased third party monitors be better suited to interpret situations and make decisions for the parties involved? How might augmenting our experience help us become more aware in our relationships, shift us out of normal patterns, and open us to unexpected possibilities? I am developing a system like this for myself using Amazon Mechanical Turk. During a series of dates with new people I meet on the internet, I will stream the interaction to the web using an iPhone app. Turk workers will be paid to watch the stream, interpret what is happening, and offer feedback as to what I should do or say next. This feedback will be communicated to me via text message." (McCarthy)


#####Smell Dating (2016)

Tega Brain and Sam Lavigne created a smell based dating service for one hundred people in New York City. Participants were sent a shirt, asked to wear it for three days and return it. They were then sent 10 annonymous samples of other participant's t-shirts from which to choose dates.
