### Conceptual Prompts: Social Glitch 


Glitch:   
Breaching experiments:  
Social hacking:   

In pairs, consider the themes explored in the works from the lecture. (intmacy across distance, designing strict limits, introduction of other intelligences/agencies, collective memory, experimental collaboration, social glitch).

Discuss one of these themes and spend 15 minutes ideating a series of simple instructions or prompts in the tradition of Yoko Ono's grapefruit or Garfinkle's breaching experiment to explore the nature of communication and social spaces. These should aim to do one or more of the following: 

* reveal trouble or break a social convention  
* shift your perspective by:  
* attunning your attention to an interaction that is typically overlooked    
* defamilarize or estrange a way of communicating (eg. with a social convention, your device, a platform, an app etc.) 

Your primpts should be small gestures that can be described in one sentence or simple instruction. Brainstorm a list in your groups. Discuss how you could take such a prompt and translate it into a project or software interface that produces a similar estrangement. Come back and share one or two of these that were most interesting to you. 

*Exercise inspired by Lauren Mccarthy and Kyle McDonald. See their class for further examples and resources - [Appropriating Interaction Technologies](https://github.com/lmccart/SocialHacking)*
