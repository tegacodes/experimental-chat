### p5 + websockets demo

* p5js  
* Sockets and Node  
* Glitch   

#### Working with Glitch:  
* In browser code editor and server  
* [Glitch tips](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ld-glitch-tips?path=README.md%3A1%3A0).   
* [Shiffman tutorial on web application deployment with Glitch (and github).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz886HkV1j4)  
* Note that these examples use socket 2.3.0 rather than socket 3.0. If you use Glitch to install socket it will default install the latest version but this gave me errors.
